# HTPmod: Model and Visualize Large-Scale Biological Data

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/HTPmod](https://shinyappstore.com/a/HTPmod)__

HTPmod is a versatile application designed for modeling and visualizing large-scale datasets obtained from high-throughput plant phenotyping (HTP) or high-throughput sequencing (HTS) experiments. Plant phenotyping involves the quantitative measurement of plant traits, such as growth patterns, under various conditions. For instance, growMod, one of the modules in HTPmod, facilitates plant growth modeling using time-series data from HTP experiments. Another module, predMod, includes prediction models to identify relationships between independent measurements and target traits, aiding in understanding complex factors like the impact of chromatin features on gene expression or predicting plant biomass from image-derived features. The third module, htpdVis, employs machine learning approaches like PCA, t-SNE, SOM, MDS, K-MC, or HCA with heatmap to explore and visualize high-dimensional data effectively. Overall, HTPmod enhances the analysis and interpretation of large-scale datasets, contributing to advancements in plant research and phenotyping methodologies.
